# Weather App (TestProject)

This app is the final project of the Harvard course CS50.
The application allows you to receive weather data from your current location. 
Before launching an application, a notification is displayed on the phone allowing you to use the device with the application.

## What is Weather ?

## Dark Sky

Weather uses the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to fetch weather data. To run this app, you'll need a Dark Sky API key.   
This is entirely free. To do so :

1. Create your account here and get your Dark Sky API key.
2. Open the project, and go to the NetworkManager.swift file.
3. Replace static let darkSky: String = "" by your key.
